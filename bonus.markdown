[18:34] reidnez: I feel this turning into a Chuck Norris-like meme and I like where it's going

[18:34] ecerney: "Ray, I'm trying to improve the mail app. Can you walk me through scrollviews?" - Apple scrollview engineer

[18:34] ecerney: hahahhaha i like it too

[18:34] rounak: For CALayers, we have a 4x4 transform with x,y,z. Ray has a 5x5 transform. The added axis? time!

[18:35] reidnez: Ray doesn't set constraints on views. They constrain themselves out of sheer terror.

[18:35] marin: Apple had the watch ready for years, they were just waiting for Ray to need one. (edited)

[18:35] reidnez: LOLL

[18:35] ecerney: omg

[18:36] ecerney: im dying

[18:36] rounak: Tim Cook sends an email to Ray each month, and hopes he'll get a reply

[18:36] marin: Why Ray doesn't get SourceKit crash jokes? He uses vi.

[18:37] reidnez: Ray never has to clean his build folder, because it never gets dirty in the first place.

[18:38] marin: Ray doesn't develop apps, they just sprout spontaneously in his itunesconnect.

[18:39] reidnez: Ray doesn't see the point of Metal, because he was already writing everything in perfectly-optimized assembly...in half the time.

[18:41] marin: still alive @ecerney ? should we go on?

[18:42] ecerney: I died... and have to interview a guy now

[18:42] ecerney: So I'll be back :simple_smile:

[18:49] gregheo: The poor interviewee. Eric will be shouting at him like "do YOU write in Metal? And do YOUR constraints set themselves? I thought not!!"

[18:49] cwagdev: :metal:

[18:50] marin: Ray doesn't use AutoLayout his views just know where to appear ... or else.

[18:59] rwenderlich: lol i walk away and come back to this :]

[19:08] reidnez: Ray has never seen a build error. The compiler obediently changes its rules in order to keep him happy.

[19:10] marin: When you file a radar, Apple asks Ray if it's okay if they fixed it.

[19:10] reidnez: LOL

[19:11] reidnez: Ray is so skilled, he can write elegant and beautiful PHP.

[19:11] marin: whoa!!!!

[19:11] marin: this is a *good* one
